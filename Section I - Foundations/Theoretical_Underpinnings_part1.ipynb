    "\n",
    "* Theory of risk-neutral: If not, an arbitrage would occur, where we could buy the cheaper of the replicating portfolio and the original asset, and collcet a profit without bearing any risk. This type of no-arbitrage and replication argument is at the heart of so-called risk-neutral pricing theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Risk Neutral Pricing\n",
    "* The first fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that there is no arbitrage if and only if there exists a risk-neutral measure. In this risk-neutral measure, valuations of all replicable securities can be computed by discounting prices at the risk-free rate.\n",

    "### Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)\n",
    "* Generic: In these equations we can see that the underlying asset price, or stochastic process, St, evolves according to two terms. The first term is a drift term, that defines the deterministic movement of the asset over time. The second term then represents the volatility in the stochastic process, and leverages the Brownian Motion building block.\n",
    "* Bachelier: Perhaps the simplest SDE specification is the Bachelier model where we assume that a Brownian Motion defines the volatility in the stochastic process and also allow for drift in the underlying asset.\n",
    "* Black-Scholes leads to the well-known Black-Scholes formula. Specification of the Black-Scholes dynamics, as we have done in (2.37), yields asset prices, St that are log-normally distributed, in contrast to the normally distributed asset prices in the Bachelier model.\n",

    "# Modeling the Physical Measure\n",
    "In this chapter we transition from working in the risk-neutral measure where we\n",
    "can replicate a contingent claim using a combination of simpler assets, to the physical measure, where investors are risk-averse, replication arguments are no longer possible and instead we must rely on our ability to forecast. In the physical measure we are no longer interested in the market implied prices, as determined by a set of options, we are interested in actual future outcomes of the assets themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficient Market Hypothesis\n",
    "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a key tenet of financial market theory and\n",
    "states that asset prices reflect all available information. This means that, according to the EMH, investors should not be able to consistently outperform on a risk-adjusted\n",
    "basis\n",
    "The efficient market hypothesis is broken into three forms, weak, semi-strong and\n",
    "strong market efficiency, each of which is described below:\n",
    "* Weak: Current prices reflect all information available in historical prices. If this\n",
    "form of efficiency is true, then technical analysis and quant strategies based on\n",
    "momentum and mean-reversion should fail to generate excess profits.\n",
    "* Semi-Strong: Current prices reflect all publicly available information about a\n",
    "firm or asset. If this form of market efficiency is correct, then investors cannot\n",
    "generate profits by relying on fundamental data for a company, trading based on\n",
    "news releases, earnings statements, or any other information that is accessible\n",
    "to a broad set of investors.\n",
    "* Strong: Current prices reflect all public and private information related to a\n",
    "firm. If this form of market efficiency is to be believed, then even insider trading\n",
    "cannot generate excess returns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Anomalies\n",
    "These behavioral phenomenon (bias) give rise to the notion of underlying risk premia. Behavioral finance, and risk premia are introduced and explored further in the next section.\n",
    "* **momentum effect**\n",
    "* Another documented anomaly is that firms with low book-to-market values tend to outperform over longer periods than firms with high book-to-market values [74]. This phenomenon is often referred to as the value premia, or **value effect**.\n",
    "* Kahneman [114], for example, postulated that investors inherently are characterized by loss aversion, meaning they are more concerned with avoiding losses than they are with achieving gains. A canonical example of a risk premia is a premium earned from selling insurance. When buying homeowner’s insurance, for example, homeowner’s are happily willing to pay the prevailing market rate generally without asking questions. Fundamentally, this is to avoid large lump sum payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "A future return, meaning we are making a forecast, and there are several variables\n",
    "that we postulate have some bearing on that future return. The main assumptions embedded in a linear regression model:\n",
    "1. Linear relationship between dependent and explanatory variables:\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity & Independence of Residuals\n",
    "3. Lack of High Correlation Between Explanatory Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of this is when we build an expected return model. In this case, we will build expected returns that are conditional on a set of explanatory variables. In the equity markets, these explanatory variables may be motivated by a companies balance sheet, earnings estimates, press releases or other fundamental data. For example, a commonly used value signal uses current price-to-earnings or price-to-book as a forecast for subsequent returns. In many cases the explanatory variable may be a return from a previous period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we often rely on regression techniques to build factor models that are based on contemporaneous regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series\n",
    "Modeling the evolution of a series over time, that is indexed by time in a specific order. \n",
    "Perhaps the most fundamental defining feature of time series data is whether it is\n",
    "stationary or non-stationary. Non-stationary means that the distribution evolves over time, which creates challenges when modeling the process. Stationary processes, on the other hand, have the same distributional properties regardless of time, making them comparatively easier to model because we know all observations emanate from the\n",
    "same distribution, making the distribution we are looking to forecast more tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it is convenient to first de-trend and remove these components, such as seasonality, prior to analyzing the time series\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of stationary asset price processes is that they imply a mean-reverting component. It means that divergences from a trend or baseline are likely to revert. \n",
    "* mean-reversion signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if data is non-stationary, as it is in a random walk, as we will soon see,\n",
    "then it is commonplace to difference the data. The difference, then, is often stationary.\n",
    "This is the case in a random walk, which is non-stationary, but when differenced is\n",
    "stationary, as it is a simple white noise process. These building blocks are explored\n",
    "further in the next section. In practice, we often observe that an assets price process is non-stationary. This implies a lack of mean-reversion in the asset prices, and is in line with the EMH. In these cases, we then difference the data, and work with the return process, which is usually found to be stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ARMA models: \n",
    "In an ARMA, or Autoregressive Moving Average model, we combine parts of AR and MA models. Like AR and MA models, ARMA models are defined by the number of lags that are included in the process. In the case of an ARMA models, we need to specify the number of both AR and MA lags. ARMA(n, q), where n is the number of AR lags, q is the number of MA lags, and ϕi and θi are the model parameters for the ith AR or MA term, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Autoregressive (AR) processes allow for momentum or mean-reversion in the return process for an asset, a notable deviation from a random walk. More generally, an AR(n) process can be constructed by including lagged terms up to n. Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller test\n",
    "    * Moving Average (MA)\n",
    "    \n",
    "One approach to this is to use an **Akaikeinformation criterion (AIC)** , which is a technique for model selection that helps balance model complexity vs. model fit. Additionally, plots of the **autocor-relation** and **partial autocorrelation** function can be useful for identifying the number of significant lags\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Autocorrelation Function (ACF): measures the total autocorrelation between the process at time t and t + s without controlling for other lags.\n",
    "    * Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF): measures the partial auto-correlation between the process at time t and t+s removing the effects of the lags at time t + 1 through t + s − 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* state space representation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Panel Regression\n",
    "In many financial datasets we observe a cross-section at each point in time, and have a subsequent time series for each asset in the cross section. That is, we are often working with panel data. In the following list, we briefly describe these most common techniques\n",
    "for working with panel data:\n",
    "* **Fixed Effects:** Assume a constant slope across the panel but allow the intercept to vary. This can be equivalently formulated as including a dummy or indicator variable for each asset. \n",
    "* **Random Effects:** The distinguishing feature of a random effects model is that it allows for the effects in different assets, or groups, to be random, rather than a constant as in the fixed effects model. This random effect is assumed to be independent of the explanatory variables.\n",
    "* **Mixed Effects:** Incorporates a combination of fixed and random effects into the panel regression model for different variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio & Investment Concepts\n",
    "One of the core concepts in investing is that of a portfolio. Few if any investors choose to invest their money in a single asset. Instead, they rely on a portfolio, or set of assets. This enables them to benefit from the seminal concept of diversification. Some have even gone so far as to describe diversification as the only available free\n",
    "lunch in financial markets. \n",
    "* **Time Value of Money:** The concept of time value of money is centered on the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This concept is closely related to the idea of opportunity costs, and is fundamentally because, if we have the dollar today we can invest it and earn interest on it, or spend it and earn utility from our purchase.We can use the concept of time value of money to establish an equivalence between present and future cashflows.\n",
    "* **Compounding returns:** Another central concept in the realm of portfolio management is that of compounding, which refers to the idea that over time, investment gains are magnified as we not only earn interest on initial capital, but we also earn interest on previously earned interest.\n",
    "* **Portfolio Calculations:**  Two of the most common portfolio statistics that we will need to compute are the return and volatility, or standard deviation of a portfolio. In conjunction, these two metrics help us identify the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio which is perhaps the most common mechanism of gauging a portfolio’s attractiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrapping\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a non-parametric technique for creating sample paths from an empirical distribution. The idea behind bootstrapping is that each realization we observe is in actuality just a draw from some unobserved density. \n",
    "As bootstrapping works by re-sampling paths from an observed dataset, it is inherently a method for generating synthetic data. Use of this synthetic data can be of great use in a finance world where we are generally lacking data, however. Additionally, bootstrapping can be useful in that it gives a broad sense of the range of potential outcomes based on limited parametric assumptions about the observed\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "It has particular appeal as it provides insight into the structure of the underlying matrix. It can help us identify, for example, what are the most important drivers of variance within the set of assets. Matrix decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two chapters, we have detailed the foundational tools for modeling the risk-neutral and physical measure, respectively. In many ways, the skillset in the two worlds appears quite different. In the risk-neutral world, we rely on hedging arguments, replication and must be well versed in stochastic calculus. In the physical measure, by contrast, these replication arguments no longer help us."
