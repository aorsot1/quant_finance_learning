    "# Types of Financial Instruments\n",
    "Financial instruments may be divided into two types: cash instruments and derivative instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cash Instruments**\n",
    "The values of cash instruments are directly influenced and determined by the markets. These can be securities that are easily transferable. Cash instruments may also be deposits and loans agreed upon by borrowers and lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative Instruments**\n",
    "The value and characteristics of derivative instruments are based on the vehicle’s underlying components, such as assets, interest rates, or indices. An equity options contract, for example, is a derivative because it derives its value from the underlying stock. The option gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the stock at a specified price and by a certain date. As the price of the stock rises and falls, so too does the value of the option although not necessarily by the same percentage. There can be over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives or exchange-traded derivatives. OTC is a market or process whereby securities–that are not listed on formal exchanges–are priced and traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equity Instruments\n",
    "Businesses that rely on shareholders to fund their operations require equity instruments to act as a way to fund operations and provide proof of ownership. This type of documentation does not require a dividend return as it is based on the specific terms of the business and subsequent profits.\n",
    "* **Titled common stock:** When a public company needs to raise funds, common stock is provided to act as equity instruments. The shareholder who offers to fund the business receives co-ownership in exchange. Additionally, this ownership gives the right to vote at shareholders meetings in proportion to their ownership.\n",
    "* **Preferred stock:** Preferred stock is another type of equity instrument that is similar to common stock. The difference between the two is that preferred shareholders receive capital repayment before common stock shareholders but do not have voting rights.\n",
    "* **Convertible debenture:** is another type of equity instrument which is similar to common bonds, the only difference being that a convertible debenture can be converted into common stock during the particular rates and prices mentioned in the prospectus. Unsecured bonds, such as convertible debentures, may or may not have collateral as a back up. That risk is mitigated by the conversion to common stock, which allows the investor to become a co-owner.\n",
    "* **A warrant:** is a type of equity instrument that gives you the right to trade shares at a specific price and date in the future. If you don't trade a warrant by its expiration date, you forfeit the right to do so. It is issued by the corporation itself. \n",
    "* **Options:** Similar to stocks, options are a kind of ownership in a company that is traded on a stock exchange. However, investors have the option of refusing to participate in the stock market at a predetermined price and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dividend** is the agreed upon amount that is to be paid per share. This can be for the face value or the price paid for the preferred stock, which is often the same amount. Dividends can be in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* return on investment expressed as a percentage per year\n",
    "* return of investment as a percentage of all net profits until the principal investment is paid\n",
    "* a combination of both return on and return of investment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debt instruments\n",
    "Debt instruments, typically referred to as loans, mortgages, leases, notes, and bonds, act as a contractual agreement between a financial institution and a borrower. Debt instruments fall into two designations: secured and unsecured.\n",
