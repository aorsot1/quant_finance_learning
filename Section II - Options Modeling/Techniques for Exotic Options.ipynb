    "# Chapter 10: Pricing Techniques for Exotic Options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to handling exotic options: simulation and numerical solutions to partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "A brief list of other applications of simulation which are discussed in the remainder\n",
    "of the book are:\n",
    "* Risk Management: Computing risk metrics of highly dimensioned complex portfolios.\n",
    "* Portfolio Management: Simulating asset returns to aid the generation of optimal portfolios.\n",
    "* Fixed Income: Modeling bond prices and interest rate curves which are inherently multi-dimensional.\n",
    "* Credit: Simulating default events of underlying entities.\n",
    "* Statistics: Generating synthetic data from an empirical distribution (e.g., Bootstrapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceptance-rejection method is only one of many methods for accomplishing this, and this lack of efficiency makes it an unattractive method in practice. Other methods for generating standard normals include:\n",
    "* Rational Approximation Method\n",
    "* Box-Muller Method\n",
    "* Marsagliaâ€™s Polar Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Euler scheme/Euler discretization of ST**: The intuition behind this approximation is that we are specifying a fine grid and the approximation can be expected to be accurate locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most common alternative schemes that use this approach are the **Milstein scheme** and the **Runge-Kutta scheme**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Four of the most common variance reduction techniques:\n",
    "* Antithetic Variables\n",
    "* Control Variates\n",
    "* Importance Sampling\n",
    "* Common Random Numbers"
