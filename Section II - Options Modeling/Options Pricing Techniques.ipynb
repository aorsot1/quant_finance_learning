    "# Chapter 9: Option Pricing Techniques for European Options\n",

    "## Quadrature\n",
    "In the absence of a closed form solution to European options pricing problems, a\n",
    "natural next method is to rely on quadrature to approximate the pricing integral.\n",
    "Said differently, in order to calculate the pricing integral, we approximate the integral\n",
    "numerically as the sum over a set of discretized points. For this method to work,\n",
    "knowledge of the risk-neutral probability density function for the stochastic process\n",
    "will be required. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to approximate an integral numerically, we can use one of many quadrature rules. These rules define how we approximate the area of each sub-interval. \n",
    " * Left-Point Rule: assume the function, f(x) takes on a constant value corresponding to the value at the left hand side of the sub-interval.\n",
    " * Right-Point Rule: assumed to take on the value at the right hand side of the sub-interval\n",
    " * Mid-Point Rule: assumed to take on the value at the mid-point of the subinterval\n",
    " * Trapezoidal Rule: when using the trapezoidal rule we approximate the function as the average of the left-point and right-point rules, forming a trapezoid in each sub-interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other rules exist, such as Simpson’s rule and those based on Lagrange Polynomials and\n",

    "* Inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "* Characteristic Function\n",
    "* strike grid\n",
    "* New terms: \n",
    "    * moment-generating functions\n",
    "    * Fubini’s theorem\n",
    "    * incorporation of a **damping factor** α will force the integral to converge.\n",
    "    * greek letters in quant finance \n",
    "    \n",
    "Option pricing via FFT is characterized by the following set of technique parameters:\n",
    "* α: damping factor introduced to ensure convergence of inner integral.\n",
    "* N: number of nodes in algorithm, must be of form: N = 2n\n",
    "* B: upper bound of pricing integral.\n",
    "* ∆ν: spacing between nodes in pricing integral.\n",
    "* ∆k: spacing between nodes on strike spacing grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "* Provides a flexible, efficient method for pricing European options with a wide array of models.\n",
    "* Prices entire volatility skews with the same effort required to produce single option price.\n",
    "* Naturally lends itself to a general pricing framework with models easily substituted for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "* Difficult to extend to non-standard payoffs.\n",
    "* Impossible to extend to path dependent options.\n",
    "* Model prices are sensitive to parameters, α, N and B.\n",
    "* Unable to accurately price highly out-of-the-money options\n",
    "\n",
    "Variants\n",
    "* Fractional FFT: A modification of the standard FFT technique where we decouple the strike spacing grid ∆k from the grid related to the integral of the characteristic function ∆ν.\n",
    "* COS Method: Relies on a Fourier Cosine expansion to using the characteristic function to compute the coefficients in the expansion.\n",
    "* Saddlepoint Method: Treats option prices as tail probabilities and approximates these via a model’s Cumulant Generating Function.\n",
