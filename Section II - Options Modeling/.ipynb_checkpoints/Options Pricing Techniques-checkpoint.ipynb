    "# Chapter 9: Option Pricing Techniques for European Options\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closed-forms solutions or aymptotic\n",
    "\n",
    "* BSE, Bachelier, CEV\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quadrature\n",
    "\n",
    "## FFFT\n",
    "* Fourier Transform\n",
    "* Inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "* Characteristic Function\n",
    "* strike grid\n",
    "* New terms: \n",
    "    * moment-generating functions\n",
    "    * Fubini’s theorem\n",
    "    * incorporation of a **damping factor** α will force the integral to converge.\n",
    "    * greek letters in quant finance \n",
    "    \n",
    "Option pricing via FFT is characterized by the following set of technique parameters:\n",
    "* α: damping factor introduced to ensure convergence of inner integral.\n",
    "* N: number of nodes in algorithm, must be of form: N = 2n\n",
    "* B: upper bound of pricing integral.\n",
    "* ∆ν: spacing between nodes in pricing integral.\n",
    "* ∆k: spacing between nodes on strike spacing grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "* Provides a flexible, efficient method for pricing European options with a wide array of models.\n",
    "* Prices entire volatility skews with the same effort required to produce single option price.\n",
    "* Naturally lends itself to a general pricing framework with models easily substituted for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "* Difficult to extend to non-standard payoffs.\n",
    "* Impossible to extend to path dependent options.\n",
    "* Model prices are sensitive to parameters, α, N and B.\n",
    "* Unable to accurately price highly out-of-the-money options\n",
    "\n",
    "Variants\n",
    "* Fractional FFT: A modification of the standard FFT technique where we decouple the strike spacing grid ∆k from the grid related to the integral of the characteristic function ∆ν.\n",
    "* COS Method: Relies on a Fourier Cosine expansion to using the characteristic function to compute the coefficients in the expansion.\n",
    "* Saddlepoint Method: Treats option prices as tail probabilities and approximates these via a model’s Cumulant Generating Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Root Finding\n",
    "A common form of optimization problem is to find the place where a function crosses 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Newton’s method** is an iterative root finding algorithm that uses information from the function and its derivatives to determine the next step in the algorithm, θ\n",
    "* **First Calibration:** The simplest calibration problem we face in quant finance is an implied volatility calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization \n",
    "Generally speaking optimization problems in finance are characterized by multiple parameters. A few examples of where optimization techniques may\n",
    "be applied in finance are:\n",
    "* Calibration: Finding an optimal set of parameters to fit a volatility surface\n",
    "* Estimation: Finding the best fit line to forecast an asset price\n",
    "* Asset Allocation: Constructing an optimal portfolio given a set of constraints.\n",
    "* Yield Curve Construction: Finding the model rates that best match traded market rate products.\n",
    "* Risk Neutral Density Extraction: Extracting a set of probabilities that best fit market data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to f(x) as the objective function in our optimization. We refer to g(x) ≤ c as the constraints in our optimization\n",
    "* Lagrange Multipliers\n",
    "* unconstrained optimization\n",
    "* Convex Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calibration of volatility surfaces\n",
    "There are two general methods for calibrating a volatility surface to a set of market\n",
    "data:\n",
    "* Parametric: Begin with a model or stochastic process and find the parameters that lead to the best fit to option prices\n",
    "* Non-Parametric: Attempt to extract a set of probabilities directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization algorithms can be classified into two main groups: gradient-based and\n",
    "gradient-free.\n",
    "* Gradient-based methods utilize information about the function and its derivative in order to determine each iterative step.\n",
    "* Gradient-free methods utilize only information about the function in order to determine the next step."
