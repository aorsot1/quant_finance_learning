    "What these models will fail to do is provide a single, unified, consistent set of dynamics for the entire volatility surface. To accomplish this, we will need to rely on a more realistic and advanced model. There are three approaches that we can use to try to make our SDEs more accurately reflect market dynamics:\n",

    "In the Local Volatility model, we make volatility a deterministic function of the current state. That is, volatility may depend on time and the underlying asset price, but it is not stochastic. This dependence of the volatility on the asset price enables us to match the volatility smile, and its dependence on time helps us to match the volatility term structure.\n",
